# Payment #

The following are the types of payments:

> __cashreceipt__ = paid in cash referenced by cash receipt. It can be manually captured or automatically captured by the treasury cash receipt system
> __credit__ = this is system generated and bill items are paid using the advance payments such as deposits. This is applied during the billing run before the readings are made. 
> __promissory__ = in some instances where the customer applies for a promissory note like a compromise payment. The items are paid and transferred to the recurring fee where it is billed on an installment basis.
