# Create Initial Bill #
The initial bill must be created for accounts that are already existing. You may opt to capture the latest bill as the initial bill so that it will be ready on the next billing run. All succeeding bills will be generated by the system, i.e. a bill will be created per month per account. Before performing the ff. task, please read first the __Billing__ section to understand the process flow. To do the initial bill, perform the ff:

> 1. Get the latest bill for the account. 
> 2. Calculate the beginning balance forwarded from the previous month of this bill. For example, if the initial bill is January 2020, calculate the total balance unpaid or excess payment until December 2019. 
> 3. Get all payments already made for this bill if any and pertinent information like O.R. No, amount and date paid.

To create an initial bill, open the customer account. Click on __Generate Initial Bill__. *(If you see View Bill or Create Direct Bill, this means there was already an initial bill already created)*. Once clicked, you will see the ff. screen:

> __Year__ - The bill year for the bill you want to create. 

> __Month__ -  The bill month for the bill you want to create.

> __Bill Ref No__ - The bill reference for the existing system used.

> __Balance Forward__ - This is the accumulated balance forwarded from the bill of the previous month. If there is excess payment, enter the amount as a negative value. 

If finished, click on Submit. This will save the bill. 


## Adding Previous Entries ##

If the balance forward specified is a positive value, you must input previous entries. There must be at least one previous entry. The screen below will be displayed:

Click on the `Add Item` button to add entries. This will popup the ff. screen:

Click the `Save` button to save the entry. This should appear on the list. You can opt to save as many items if you want. For example, if you are implementing the monthly interest then you must encode each month as the system will use this as the basis for its computation. More importantly, make sure that the total amount encoded should total the balance forward amount. If you made a mistake in the balance forward amount, then you must Cancel the bill and redo it. When done click on the Next button.






============


In the Ledger tab of the customer account, click on the `Add Ledger Entry` button. The ledger entry form will be displayed. Enter the data as follows:
- __Item__ - Lookup the appropriate item account. If the entry not in the list, you can go to the Waterworks ItemAccount list and add the entry. See section *Waterworks Itemaccount*.

- __Year__ - Enter Year of period.
- __Month__ - Enter Month of period.
- __Amount__ - Enter Amount. If it is partially paid, enter the remaining balance. 
- __Particulars__ - Specify specific details of this entry. 
- __System Generated__ - is an informational value indicating if the entry was created by the system. If created by the system it cannot be edited.

Click on `Save` to add the entry on the list. To edit, select the item in the list and click on `Open`. When the form appears, click on the `Edit` button to make the fields editable.

If there are prior balances from the current period, you need to add ledger entries using the previous year and month. If you are implementing interest per month penalty for unpaid dues, then you must make the water sales entries for every month so that the system can automatically compute it in the succeedung billings. Otherwise just enter the prior year and month and summarize all the other balances so it will be easier.

Once completed, click on the Generate Bill to view the initial bill.

## Adding Consumption ##
This entry is required for customer accounts that have meters. The meter readings should be added in sequence i.e. the first entry you will make will  be the initial reading. Once added, the system will automatically increment by month the next readings and you wont be able to edit the year and month of succeeding. So it is very important to ensure first that the initial entry will be correct, otherwise you will have to delete and re encode everything. 



## Adding Credits ##

On the other hand, if there are no previous unpaid balances but there is overpayment, you need to record this in the credits entry. This will have a negative value effect in the balance forward. To add credits, go to the Credits Tab of the customer account then click on the `Add Credit Entry` button. Fill in the necessary data and click on save.

- __Year__ - Enter Year of period.
- __Month__ - Enter Month of period.
- __Amount__ - Enter Amount of excess payment.
- __Particulars__ - Specify specific details of this entry.
- __System Generated__ - is an informational value indicating if the entry was created by the system. If created by the system it cannot be edited. 




## Create First Bill ##
Click on the `Generate Bill` button. It will display the current values for your confirmation. The system will default or suggest the validity date based on the current date. In the first billing, the system will not run the rules and will just collect whetever is inputted in the ledgers. Specify the __Validity Date__. By setting this value, it will instruct the billing to automatically update the bill once this date has arrived. For example, if the date you prepared the bill is before its due date, there will still be no penalty at the time of generating the bill. The validity date you need to set it should be its due date. 



Once the bill is activated, the system keeps track of this date and it will automatically update the bill when the time expires.

After the bill is created and the account activated, you cannot manually add entries anymore to the credits and payment side of the ledger.


### Conditions for Approval ###

- __For New Account__. If this is an entirely new account and there are no readings yet, a ledger may not be necessary unless there are some charges you want included such as material fees and the like. This is automatically done if this were through the New Connection transaction. However, in capture mode, the fees and charges must be encoded manually in the ledger. To add ledger entries go to *Building Ledgers* section. Next ensure that there will be a previous consumption entry. This will be the initial reading.  

- __For existing Accounts without balance__. 

- __For existing Accounts with balance__. 

Before a system can be approved, the system will ensure that the billings will be in sync when you start. It is important that you build first the current ledger once and the system will continue
