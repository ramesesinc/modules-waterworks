## Notes ##

 - 1) Expirydate is derived from nextbilldate. To do this find the next period by adding one month to the bill year and month and call `WaterworksScheduleService.getSchedule` and pass the subarea.schedulegroupid and the next month year. Get the billdate and deduct one day. Once this date is surpassed by the current date any payments made will not be accepted anymore to reference this bill. 

 - 2) balanceforward is calculated as follows:
	- Find the previous bill and close it first. Bill can be closed even if it is not yet expired. 
	- Run the rules to calculate penalties to update the ledger, update the previous bill status to 2 and lastprocessdate to currentdate.
	- Retrieve all waterworks_ledger for account where amount - amtpaid - discount > 0 and month year <= previous bill month and year
	- Summarize total of item 2 into total_unpaid
	- Get sum of waterworks_credit dr-cr and save as total_credits
	- balanceforward = total_unpaid - total_credits
	- Compare it with the ff.formula where the billid is the objid of the previous bill (amount should be equal):
	```
	   waterworks_billing.balanceforward WHERE objid = :billid 
	   + SUM(waterworks_ledger.amount) WHERE billid = :billid  
	   + SUM(waterworks_payment.amount) WHERE billid = :billid
	```
