# Getting Started #

To have better result in implementing this system, it is recommended to do it in phases as follows: 

- __1)__ Billing and Collection Process 
- __2)__ Processing Transactions 
- __3)__ Mobile Reading Transactions. 


## Phase 1 ## 

To implement the billing and collection process it is necessary to first set up the necessary data. The system was designed to be highly configurable thus requires a lot of rule setup. However, there are templates provided that can be simply edited to suit the requirements. This assumes that you have already setup the system otherwise refer to the Installtion section. 

The steps are summarized as follows:
- 1. Set up the billing period schedule
- 2. Define areas, subareas and stubouts
- 3. Manage Meter
- 4. Capture Account 
- 5. Setup the item accounts
- 6. Setup consumption and billing rules
- 7. Create an initial bill and generate direct bills
- 8. Perform batch billing, processing, reading, printing and posting
- 9. Collection
- 10. Viewing Statements and reports

## Phase 2 ## 
Handles different transactions for the system. It includes, but not limited to the ff:
- Application for new connection
- Change Requests 
- Disconnection and Reconnection
- Billing Adjustments

## Phase 3 ##
Is optional and applicable only if the mobile application was purchased. 

This manual follows a guided procedure based on the activity of processing transactions.
